# To-do List

> Solo programming project for week one of module 2 of the Microverse Program.

<!-- ![Desktop Version](./src/imgs/todo-list.png)
![Mobile Version](./src/imgs/todo-mobile.png) -->

"To-do List" is a simple website that displays a list of books and allows you to add and remove books from that list.

### First requirements:


    Set up a new project with webpack that is based on the webpack exercise you have already completed.
    Create an index.html file and write your HTML markup here. Create an empty To Do List placeholder (<div> or <ul> element). The index.html file must be set as a template using the HTML Webpack Plugin.
    Create an index.js file and set an array of some simple to do tasks (array of objects). Each task object should contain three keys:
        description [string].
        completed [bool].
        index: [number].
    Write a function to iterate over the tasks array and populate an HTML list item element for each task.
    On page load render the dynamically created list of tasks in the dedicated placeholder. The list should appear in order of the index values for each task.
    Create a style.css and set rules for the To Do List. CSS must be loaded by Webpack Style/CSS Loader. Your list should be a clone of the part of the minimalist project captured in the video provided by Microverse.

    All your source files (index.html, index.js and style.css) must be located in /src directory and your distribution files will be generated by webpack and served by webpack dev server from /dist folder.

### Second requirements:


    Add a new JavaScript file and import it as a module:
        it will contain methods related to the status updates (completed: true / false).
    Add event listener to the checkbox (change).
    Update items object's value for completed key upon user actions.
    Implement a function for the "Clear all completed" button (use filter() method).
    Store the updated array of items in local storage, so the user gets the correct list values after the page reloads.
